    languages with only basic syntax colorization

    XML

    C#
    C++
    Razor
    Markdown
    Diff
    Java
    VB

## Potential Ideas
1. coding mode -> doc mode
    this would be presented with coding option like lang and stuff
    doc mode would be stuff like spacing and font
2. Store user ids in db so that users have their ids displayed when mouse hovered over
If they dont put in username then default is random
